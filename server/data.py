At baseline, 81 adults with LCH (27 with childhood onset, 56% females), mean age at GHD onset of 29 (15) years were studied. Diabetes insipidus was diagnosed in 86% of patients. Analysis of 1 year of GH treatment was possible in 37 patients. One-year cross-sectional values for the GH dose were 0.39 (s.d.± 0.21) mg and -0.5 (-1.2 to 0.2) for insulin-like growth factor-1 s.d. Total cholesterol decreased 0.9 (-1.5 to -0.3 (mmol/L); P < 0.05); AGHDA-QoL-score (n = 20) was improved by 2.8 points (-5.6 to 0.0; P < 0.05), while mean BMI increased 0.6 ± 3 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.2 to 1.4).

In narcolepsy (DHx+ and DHx-), 40-min Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT40) mean sleep latency increased (5.4 and 7.0 min), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score decreased (3.8 and 3.5 points), and percentage of participants improved on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) was higher (31.7% and 39.4%) relative to placebo. In OSA (DHx+ and DHx-), MWT40 mean sleep latency increased (7.7 and 10.7 min), ESS decreased (3.5 and 3.7 points), and percentage of participants improved on PGI-C was higher (41.1% and 29.4%) relative to placebo. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (headache, decreased appetite, nausea, anxiety) were similar in DHx+/DHx-. This study suggests that safety and efficacy of solriamfetol for treating EDS in narcolepsy and OSA are not affected by depression history.

        "abstract": "Objective: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem neurocutaneous disorder associated with cortical tubers, brain lesions seen in nearly all patients with TSC, which are frequently epileptogenic. Seizures are often the earliest clinical manifestation of TSC, leading to epilepsy in over 70% of patients. Medical management with antiepileptic drugs constitutes early therapy, but over 50% develop medically refractory epilepsy, necessitating surgical evaluation and treatment. The objective of this study was to summarize the literature and report seizure outcomes following surgical treatment for TSC-associated epilepsy. METHOD :A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for journal articles reporting seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery in TSC patients. Included studies were placed into one of two groups based on the surgical technique used. Excellent and worthwhile seizure reductions were defined for each group as outcomes and extracted from each study.",
        "results": "A total of 46 studies were included. Forty of these studies reported seizure outcomes following any combination of resection, disconnection, and ablation on a collective 1157 patients. Excellent and worthwhile seizure reductions were achieved in 59% (683/1157) and 85% (450/528) of patients, respectively. Six of these studies reported seizure outcomes following treatment with neuromodulation. Excellent and worthwhile seizure reductions were achieved in 34% (24/70) and 76% (53/70) of patients, respectively."

        "abstract": "A 26-year-old woman with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) received outpatient treatment for the complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at our hospital. She visited our hospital with a chief complaint of pitting oedema in bilateral lower legs for 3 days. The urinalysis showed massive proteinuria with a lot of white blood cell casts. The blood tests revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypocomplementaemia, and elevated anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titre. Renal biopsy was not performed because of multiple renal angiomyolipomas, which was one of the features of TSC. She was diagnosed with a nephrotic state due to lupus nephritis. Although she had a standard therapy with high-dose corticosteroid and mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, complete remission had not been achieved leading to a steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. During the follow-up, the angiomyolipomas became larger and had a risk of rupture at the age of 29 years. Everolimus, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, was started for the treatment of angiomyolipomas, and mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus were terminated instead. The activity of lupus nephritis was surprisingly ameliorated, and the amount of corticosteroid successfully tapered. Everolimus has been continued for 6 years without severe side effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that the activated mTOR pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of SLE. We reported the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus for refractory SLE in a patient with TSC for the first time. This case suggests that everolimus can be a promising option for the treatment of lupus nephritis.",

These germline pathogenic variants are hereditary and are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. There are two major lung cancer susceptibility syndromes, and both seem to be specifically associated with the adenocarcinoma subtype. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by variants in the TP53 tumour-suppressor gene. Carriers are mainly at risk of early-onset breast cancer, sarcoma, glioma, leukaemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma and lung cancer. EGFR variants, T790M in particular, cause the EGFR susceptibility syndrome. Risk seems limited to lung cancer. Emerging data suggest that variants in ATM, the breast and pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene, also increase lung adenocarcinoma risk. As for inherited lung disease, cancer risk is increased in SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 variant carriers independently of the underlying fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "There exists no consensus in the literature regarding the impact of pre-stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) embolization on obliteration rates and clinical outcome after radiosurgery treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We performed a systematic review of four databases and included studies with at least 10 patients evaluating obliteration rates of intracranial AVMs treated with SRS alone (SRS cohort) and combined pre-SRS embolization followed by SRS (E + SRS cohort). Meta-analytic results were pooled together via random-effects models. A total of 43 studies, with 7103 patients, were included in our analysis. Among our included patients, complete obliteration was achieved in 51.5% (964/1871) of patients in the E + SRS cohort as compared to 61.5% (3217/5231) of patients in the SRS cohort. Meta-analysis of the pooled data revealed that obliteration was significantly lower in the E + SRS cohort (pooled OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.54-0.75, p < 0.0001). The use of pre-SRS embolization was significantly associated with lower AVM obliteration rates when compared to treatment with SRS alone. Our analysis seeks to provide a macroscopic insight into the complex interaction between pre-SRS embolization and brain AVM obliteration rates and prognosis. Pre-SRS embolization may still be beneficial in select patients, and further studies are needed to identify patients who benefit from neoadjuvant AVM embolization.",
